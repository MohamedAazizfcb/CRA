CRA (Celebritized Reader for Audiobooks)

Voice cloning is not the same as voice transformation, mimicking not only the pitch and other perceivable signal qualities,
but also the style of the target speaker.
CRA is cloning celebritiesâ€™ voices to read Audiobooks without really recording their voices while narrating books.
This is the power of Machine Learning and technology which save time, effort and money costs.
